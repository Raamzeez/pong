# Pong Game with Blasters

This project is a creative twist on the classic Pong game, built using HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. In this version, players control paddles to hit a ball back and forth, but there's an added challenge: each player has a blaster that can shoot bullets to change the speed of the ball. Additionally, items appear that allow players to reload bullets or repair destroyed blasters.

## Features

- **Classic Pong gameplay**: Control paddles to hit the ball and score points.
- **Added Blasters**: Each player can shoot bullets to influence the ball's speed.
- **Item Pickups**: Players can collect items to reload their blasters or repair destroyed cannons.
- **Dynamic Ball Physics**: The ball's speed changes based on interactions with bullets, paddles, and items.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Raamzeez/pong.git
   cd pong
   
2. Open the index.html file located in the *public* folder

## How to Play

- Player 1 (left side) uses W and S keys to move the paddle up and down, and Shift to shoot bullets.
- Player 2 (right side) uses the Arrow Up and Arrow Down keys to move the paddle, and Left Arrow to shoot bullets.

The game will automatically track the score and handle resets after goals.
Pick up items to reload your blasters or repair destroyed cannons.
